## Strings and Dates in R

This repo contains materials for a CSCAR workshop on String and Dates in R.

For dates, we will focus on useful features from the `lubrdiate` package.

For strings, we will focus on useful tools form the `stringr` library.

To get acclimated, we will review select material in two chapters from 
[*R For Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. 

After each chapter, we will review some practical examples and 
work on a few exercise.

## Dates

To get started, we will review the [Dates and Times](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)
chapter in *R for Data Science*.  Some of the key material has already been typed out in the
script [./Dates.R](./Dates.R).

Midway through we will look at the first half of the example 
[Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths.R](./Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths.R).

Finally, we will look at the example in [./hypo_thyroid_example.R](./hypo_thyroid_example.R).


## Strings

Let's start by reviewing some material from the [Strings](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html) chapter.

Then we will work through the second half of the earlier example
[Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths.R](./Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths.R).
